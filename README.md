# Cal State Fullerton Public Administration and Political Science Honor Societies Website

This repository contains the official website for two honor societies at Cal State Fullerton. As the faculty advisor for these societies, I've developed this site to provide essential information and resources for current and prospective members.

## Features

- **Membership Information**: Details about how to become a member and the benefits of joining.
- **Events**: Upcoming and past events organized by the societies.
- **Qualifications**: Criteria for joining the honor societies.
- **Resources**: Useful resources for members and those interested in the fields of Public Administration and Political Science.
- **Scholarship**: Information about scholarship opportunities available to members.
- **Application Form**: Integrated with Formspree and reCaptcha for secure and efficient form submissions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: Core technologies for structuring and styling the website.
- **Bootstrap**: The site uses the latest Bootstrap framework for responsive design and modern styling.
- **Formspree & reCaptcha**: For secure form submissions and spam prevention.

## Notes

- The site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages. Users who fork or clone the repository should host the site on their own server.
